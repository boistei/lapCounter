Score Keeper

What started off as a simple score keeper app using DOM is now being changed to lap counter for my walks around my building.

I have divided the track into 4 parts so increments can be 0.25 or 0.5 or 1 full lap around the building and 4.5 such laps around the building would mean I covered 1 km.
